# Speech Therapy Website - https://www.logopeda-czechowice.pl/

## Project Overview
This project is a user-friendly website I developed for my mom, who is a passionate speech therapist starting her own little business.

## Key Features
- **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to provide an optimal viewing experience across various devices, such as smartphones and tablets.

- **User-Friendly Navigation:** A well-organized menu and intuitive layout make it easy for visitors to find crucial information on the page.

## Technologies Used
I leveraged a variety of technologies and tools to create this website, including:

- **Front-end:** React.js was the backbone for this project. Apart from the visual design, I focused on the content quality, meta titles and descriptions, as well as h1 tags and other nitty gritty SEO thingies in order to further improve the page's Google ranking.

- **Back-end:** I also used Node.js with Nodemailer to receive emails from potential customers, later gave up this idea due to long time of email sending (check this functionality [here](https://logopeda-wiola.onrender.com/kontakt) - I am gonna get your message)!

- **Database:** I used MongoDB for this project.

- **Hosting and Deployment:** For the hosting provider I chose [cyber_Folks](https://cyberfolks.pl/).
